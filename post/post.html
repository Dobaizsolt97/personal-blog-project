          you some places that i am sure will make you want to do some extra
          research.

        <h3>What about the locals?</h3>
        <p>
          They are a welkoming bunch, i traveled the country for a month and i alternated between renting a room trough applications and 
          asking the locals to directly rent a room, more often than not they were glad to help and welkomed me into their home.

        <h2>Housing and prices</h2>
        <h3>Prices are fair</h3>
        <p>
          For a couple hundred euros you can have an amazing vacation
          renting an apartment for 2 persons is usualy around 30 euro/nignt 
          and for this price, some of the rooms you get are unbelivable.
          In Brasov i got a room in the middle of the city near one of the biggest
          attractions, and it looked like i was in a 5 stars hotel, and guess what, the total 
          price was 30 euoros, for 2 nights.
        </p>
        <h3>A good tip</h3>
        <p>
          Romania is very popular thanks to vampire stories surrounding Bran Castle also known by its tourist name Dracula's Castle. 
          But there's so much more to our country than just one castle and fictional vampire stories. 
          Romanian cities have a vibe of their own which is worth experiencing but if you want to see the major tourist attractions
          in Romania you need to travel deeper in the country to the regions of Transylvania, Bukovina or Maramures.
          Romania's major attractions, unspoilt natural beauty and true local life is best experienced outside of major cities.
          Most tourists come to Romania keen on visiting Dracula's Castle but once they go beyond that and start looking for the 'real'
          Romania - surprise and wonder sets in!
